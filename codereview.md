# Code Review Findings

## Status
- All previously reported high-severity issues have been addressed. No new blocking problems were found in this pass.

## Verification
- `microflow/storage/json_store.py:92-117` — Confirmed `update_ctx` and `upsert_task` now wrap the load/update/save sequence in a shared lock, preventing lost updates when multiple tasks finish concurrently.
- `microflow/nodes/data_transform.py:685-756` — `select_fields` now passes the transform expression as the first argument, and `rename_fields` both forwards arguments in the correct order and injects the mapping into the eval context. Manual inspection shows these helpers now operate on the intended data.
